00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,400
England is one of the four nations that

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,920
make up the modern United Kingdom

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,800
alongside Wales Scotland and Northern

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,359
Ireland being by far the largest in

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,679
terms of land mass and population

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
England has for centuries been the most

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,879
powerful and developed Nation within the

10
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,960
British Isles having exerted its

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,040
influence over its immediate neighbors

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,160
through economic and Military

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,079
might however it may come as a surprise

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,920
to know that for much of its early

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,879
history England itself was influenced by

16
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,719
many other neighboring cultures and

17
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,719
languages from as far back as

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,120
prehistoric times England has played

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,320
host to successive waves of migration

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,680
and Conquest which over the subsequent

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,440
Millennia and centuries

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,440
have coalesced into a unique mixture of

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,199
language culture and Heritage that is

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,320
unlike anywhere else in the world but

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,720
how did this relatively small nation go

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,320
on to mold not only the future Destiny

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,799
of the British Isles but also shape much

28
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,360
of the modern world in which we live

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,880
today this is the history of

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,400
England the nation of England has been

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,840
shaped by countless political upheavals

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,280
Wars and invasions over the past several

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,720
Centuries with perhaps the most iconic

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,799
and defining of these being World War II

35
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,479

36
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,240
ultimately Victorious however if youve

become the nation of England looked very

61
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
different to the first humans who

62
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,280
settled there during the prehistoric

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,519
Stone Age back then the wider British

64
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,959
Isles weren't even Islands at all but

65
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,760
were instead connected to Continental

66
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,560
Europe by a land bridge as the last

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,519
glacial period came to an end around

68
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:55,519
11,000 years ago the melting ice sheets

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,760
caused the sea levels to rise which

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,400
subsequently flooded the low-lying land

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,040
bridge called doggerland thereby

72
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,599
permanently cutting Britain off from

73
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,040
Europe despite being separated from the

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,480
Continental Mainland communication and

75
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,000
cultural exchanges continued to occur

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,799
between the peoples of Europe and those

77
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,680
inhabiting what would eventually become

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,280
England the practice of farming which

79
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,920
originated in the Middle East was

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
introduced around 4,000 BC and the first

81
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,120
permanent settlements which possessed

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,280
Monumental tombs and ceremonial Stone

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,959
circles such as Stonehenge were also so

84
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,080
built around this time as the Stone Age

85
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,319
turned into the Bronze Age England for

86
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,360
the most part remained alike to the rest

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,360
of Britain and indeed the rest of Europe

88
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,040
similar cultural and linguistic

89
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,280
practices were introduced as a result of

90
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,920
successive waves of migration from the

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
continent which eventually morphed into

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
the Celtic culture which had become

93
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,360
widespread over much of Western Europe

94
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
by the 12th century

95
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,599
BC life for the Celtic peoples of

96
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,799
England continued in much the same way

97
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,799
for the next several Cent centuries that

98
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,280
was until the year 55 BC when an

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,159
invasion Force unlike any seen before

100
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,640
landed on the southern coast the Roman

101
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,319
Republic which would soon become the

102
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
Roman Empire was the uncontested

103
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,079
superpower of the ancient world having

104
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,000
expanded across the Mediterranean as

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,919
well as more recently further northwards

106
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,639
into what is now modern France the Roman

107
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,680
general who had led the recent conquest

108
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,840
of what was then termed ghoul was none

109
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,440
other than Julius Caesar whose Ambitions

110
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,160
soon turned to Conquering the the lands

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,919
across the English Channel Caesar's

112
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,120
initial Invasion achieved little more

113
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,280
than Landing his army on the coast and

114
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
so a second largest scale Invasion

115
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,320
followed the next year in 54 BC this

116
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,919
Invasion saw Roman Legions Advance as

117
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,639
far as the Northern Bank of the river

118
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,759
temps despite this relative success the

119
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,680
Romans could not establish a permanent

120
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,080
foothold on the island during this time

121
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,919
and so withdrew back across the channel

122
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,759
the Romans nevertheless remained

123
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,800
convinced that the island could and

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,360
should be conquered and so almost a

125
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,800
century later the Roman Emperor Claudius

126
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
ordered that a properly planned and

127
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
maintained Invasion attempt be carried

128
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
out in the year 43 ad over the following

129
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,960
decades Rome's Legions Advanced across

130
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
the land and brought almost all of what

131
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,840
is now England under Roman rule founding

132
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,360
many settlements like London Chester and

133
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,160
York in the process although Rome's

134
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,240
Authority was occasionally challenged by

135
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,720
local revolts such as the one led by

136
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,880
Queen budika in 60 AD England remained

137
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,000
an integral part of the Roman Empire for

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,280
the next several centuries and had its

139
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,400
northernmost border fixed in place with

140
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,160
the construction of Hadrian's

141
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,440
Wall like all empires in history however

142
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,319
Rome's rise and fall was inevitable and

143
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:51,319
by the beginning of the fth century its

144
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,800
power and influence had been

145
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,479
significantly reduced the last Roman

146
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,560
Legions were withdrawn from England in

147
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,720
the year 407 to defend the more valuable

148
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
parts of the Empire on the continent

149
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,319
which were being threatened by numerous

150
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,360
migrating Barbarian tribes a handful of

151
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,400
these tribes soon turned their attention

152
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,720
towards England which set in motion a

153
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,840
series of events that would establish

154
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,360
and ultimately shape the very language

155
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,720
culture and history of the English

156
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,240
people these Germanic tribes

157
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,880
collectively referred to in history as

158
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,319
the Anglo saxin first migrated to

159
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,919
England sometime during the 4th Century

160
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,720
probably serving as mercenaries in the

161
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,560
Roman army however by the mid fifth

162
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
century a significant number of these

163
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,319
peoples had settled in the Eastern

164
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,960
portion of the country the precise

165
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,919
nature of this process is still a matter

166
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,280
of debate amongst historians with some

167
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,560
advocating for a large scale Invasion

168
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,160
and violent displacement of the Native

169
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,919
Celtic population While others argue for

170
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,880
a more peaceful and gradual process of

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,000
acculturation in either case the

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,360
Anglo-Saxons replace the Romano British

173
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,919
language culture and people with their

174
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,879
own Germanic customs and ways of life

175
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,800
the language that they introduced would

176
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,840
one day evolve into the English language

177
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,240
that we speak today although the

178
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,639
Anglo-Saxons were United in tongue

179
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,400
culture and religion they were

180
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,720
politically separate having established

181
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,400
their own independent kingdoms across

182
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,360
the land by the 7th Century the native

183
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,560
Britains had withdrawn themselves to the

184
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
Far Western parts of the island such as

185
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,360

distinct but as yet disunited English

190
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,720
Nation over time the Anglo-Saxons

191
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,800
converted from their old Germanic Pagan

192
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,479
beliefs to Christianity and set about

193
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,039
consolidating power for themselves Often

194
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,879
by fighting one another as well as the

195
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,919
neighboring British kingdoms to the west

196
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,759
and PS to the north by the late 8th

197
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,080
Century the feuding Anglo-Saxons had

198
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,720
Amalgamated into four larger kingdoms

199
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,919
North Umbria meria East Anglia and

200
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,639
Wessex however the very survival of

201
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,000
anglo-saxon England would soon be called

202
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,560
into question when fleets of longboats

203
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,240
suddenly began to appear off the

204
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,199
coastline in the late 8th Century the

205
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,800
Viking age in England is widely attested

206
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
to have begun with the well documented

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,639
raid on the North umbrian Monastery of

208
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,039
lindes fan in the year

209
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,560
793 although other smaller raids had

210
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,080
been carried out in England before this

211
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,159
time as well as in other parts of the

212
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,039
British Isles what began as sporadic

213
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,240
attacks on isolated treasure Laden

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
monasteries continued well into the

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,440
following Century but in the year

216
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
865 however the Vikings adopted a change

217
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,160
in strategy from Hit and Run raiding to

218
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
one of conquest and occupation late that

219
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,959
year a vast Viking Army landed in

220
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,000
southeast England with the intention of

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
taking the land of the four Anglo-Saxon

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,120
kingdoms for themselves this great

223
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,240
heathen Army as the Anglo-Saxon

224
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,360
Chronicle referred to the Viking Force

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
first marched northwards and took

226
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,839
control of the kingdom of North Umbria

227
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,920
in 867 followed by East Anglia in 869

228
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,120
and then meria in 874 leaving only the

229
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,959
kingdom of wessix as the last

230
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,360
independent Anglo-Saxon

231
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,640
Kingdom led by King Alfred wesix had

232
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,079
thus far evaded the marauding Vikings

233
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,800
either by fighting them in battle or

234
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,560
paying them off however by 878 the

235
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,640
Vikings had overrun the greater parts of

236
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,519
wessix and forced Alfred into hiding

237
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,160
with the threat to his kingdom and the

238
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,440
future of England hanging in the balance

239
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,600
King Alfred was able to muster an army

240
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,079
for a last stand against the Vikings at

241
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,040
the Battle of Edington in May of that

242
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,959
year ultimately proving Victorious King

243
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,440
Alfred earned himself the epithet of the

244
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,560
Great by successfully driving the

245
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,680
Vikings back eastwards to the lands

246
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,560
which remained under their own rule of

247
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,839
Dane law with Anglo-Saxon do now

248
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,120
restored the kings of wesex gradually

249
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,200
began to reconquer the remaining English

250
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,519
lands under Viking occupation Alfred's

251
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,360
grandson ethelon successfully conquered

252
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,160
the kingdom of York in 927 and adopted

253
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,399
the title King of the English for the

254
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,240
first time the emergence of a now

255
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,880
unified and Powerful Kingdom of England

256
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,760
greatly alarmed the neighboring rulers

257
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
within the British is who subsequently

258
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,200
formed an alliance of Vikings and Scots

259
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
to challenge ethon's dominance in the in

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,720
the year

261
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,800
934 the resulting Battle of brunen bur

262
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,839
one of the most decisive ever fought in

263
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,639
the history of the British Isles saw

264
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,440
ethon's Army win the day and secure the

265
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,760
independence and supremacy of England

266
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,160
which was to last for the best part of a

267
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,200
century by the dawning of the New

268
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,720
Millennium however England's Kings had

269
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,360
become complacent and the threat posed

270
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,480
by marauding Danish Vikings had

271
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,920
reemerged over the following decades the

272
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,519
Throne of England passed between

273
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:01,519
Anglo-Saxon and danish rulers and at one

274
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,519
point the kingdom was ruled as part of

275
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,160
the wider Scandinavian North Sea empire

276
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,680
under King gut by the year 1042 the

277
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,720
house of wesix had been restored to the

278
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,880
throne under King Edward the Confessor

279
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,440
however his failure to produce an air

280
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,639
meant the future of England was once

281
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,959
again thrown into question by numerous

282
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,399
competing claims to be his

283
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,880
successor when Edward died in 1066 the

284
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,760
powerful English nobleman Harold

285
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,480
godwinson took to the throne much to the

286
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,959
outrage of Duke William of Normandy King

287
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,959
Harold had Radder of Norway and King

288
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,959
Swain II of Denmark who all asserted

289
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,480
claims to the throne themselves the

290
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,760
events of the year 1066 would

291
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,600
undoubtedly be the most pivotal in

292
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,800
English History and would irreversibly

293
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,440
change the very Fabric and nature of the

294
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,160
country the Battle of Stanford Bridge

295
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,519
fought in September of that year saw

296
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,800
King Harold godwinson defeat an invasion

297
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,079
Force led by his Norwegian counterpart

298
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,720
however just a few weeks later his

299
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,320
exhausted Army was forced to make a long

300
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,519
rapid March South to face another

301
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,240
Invasion Force led by dukee William the

302
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,120
Battle of Hastings which was fought on

303
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,519
the 14th of October 1066 is perhaps the

304
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,040
most infamous date in English history

305
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,399
with King Harold being killed in action

306
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,240
supposedly by taking an arrow to the eye

307
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,360
the end result was the extinguishment of

308
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,720
the Anglo-Saxon line of Kings and its

309
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,839
replacement with the new Norman French

310
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,480
Dynasty which was established by William

311
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,440
who had himself crowned as the new king

312
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,040
of England on Christmas day of that

313
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,959
year the Norman Conquest brought about a

314
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,600
profound change to the governance of

315
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,880
England after fighting off countless

316
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,920
English revolts and asserting dominance

317
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,480
over the neighboring Kingdoms in Wales

318
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,360
and Scotland King William I commissioned

319
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,120
the Doomsday Book to survey the land

320
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,279
people and monetary value of his kingdom

321
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,160
the completed work showed that

322
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,480
practically the entire Anglo-Saxon

323
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,279
nobility had been replaced with Normans

324
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,920
who had introduced French as the

325
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,000
language of the ruling aristocratic

326
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,800
Elite from this point onwards England's

327
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
future would be irrevocably intertwined

328
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,160
with that of France as many of England's

329
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Lords now also held feudal lands across

330
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,120
the channel the Norman Dynasty lasted

331
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,120
only about 80 years in England when yet

332
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,440
another succession crisis triggered open

333
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,720
civil war between Henry First's

334
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,680
legitimate successor Empress Matilda and

335
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,440
the favored candidate chosen by the

336
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,920
nobility Steven of blis the result was

337
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,079
that Steven ruled as king until his

338
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,920
death in 1154 and was to be succeeded by

339
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,519
Matilda's son Henry II as a descendant

340
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,920
of both the noble houses of Normandy and

341
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,639
plantagenet as well as through a

342
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,959
subsequent marriage to Elanor of

343
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,199
aquatain Henry II ruled not only over

344
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,560
England and parts of Wales and Ireland

345
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,759
but also over an enormous sthe of

346
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,279
Western France under what would later be

347
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,440
termed the Anin

348
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,600
Empire England was ruled by the

349
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,560
plantagenet Kings for most of the

350
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,839
medieval period but experienced a great

351
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,519
deal of mixed fortunes the late 12th

352
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,759
century through the mid- 13th centuries

353
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,519
for example was marked by calamities and

354
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,560
political turmoil as their territories

355
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,720
on the continent were greatly reduced

356
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,360
owing to conflict with the kingdom of

357
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,000
France the resulting Fallout amongst the

358
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,560
powerful English Barons led to a uction

359
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,680
in the king's absolute power with the

360
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,959
signing of Magna cataa in 1215 by King

361
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,279
John despite these measures civil war

362
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,279
between the king and the Barons

363
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,320
continued throughout much of the century

364
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,920
and only came to an end with the

365
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,759
accession of king Edward the first to

366
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,680
the throne in

367
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,000
1272 Edward strengthened the power of

368
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,839
His government with the opening of the

369
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,800
first Parliament and significantly

370
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
expanded the English influence within

371
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,040
the British Isles by conquering Wales

372
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
and attempting to do the same same to

373
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Scotland as the 14th century dawned

374
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,720
England continued to engage in

375
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,079
expansionist wars with its neighbors

376
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,360
particularly against France which began

377
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,240
the long and protracted series of

378
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,480
conflicts collectively referred to as

379
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,000
the Hundred Years War during the reign

380
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,279
of king Edward III England achieved

381
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,279
great success at the battles of pry and

382
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,320
poier however military actions soon came

383
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,279
to a halt as an altogether different and

384
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,560
more deadly enemy was about to land on

385
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,800
England's Shores the black death which

386
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,920
originated in Asia and spread throughout

387
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,680
Europe during the second half of the

388
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,839
1340s arrived in England aboard a ship

389
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,480
that had sailed from English controlled

390
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,160
gany in

391
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,399
1348 within less than 2 years the plague

392
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,920
had spread over the entire country and

393
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
is estimated to have killed as much as

394
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,360
half of the

395
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,519
population not only did this reduce the

396
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,759
Manpower for England's armies but it

397
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,720
also led to dramatic socioeconomic

398
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,440
change changes within the country itself

399
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,519
the surviving peasantry faced ever

400
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,800
increasing taxes to pay for the costly

401
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,959
Wars and were not being paid high enough

402
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:10,199
wages for their labor which was now in

403
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,079
even greater demand these tensions

404
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,160
eventually boiled over into the peasants

405
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,480
Revolt of 1381 which saw widespread

406
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,880
disturbances across the country but were

407
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,240
most concentrated in the Southeast where

408
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,839
Rebels marched on London and killed many

409
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,759
government officials whom they blamed

410
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,600
for causing their grievances

411
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,959
order was eventually restored but the

412
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,639
situation in England remained volatile

413
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,040
the unpopular King Richard II was

414
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,560
deposed in 1399 by his cousin who became

415
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,000
King Henry IV further crises and revolts

416
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,759
plagued his Reign but they were

417
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,399
successfully put down largely due to the

418
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,000
military actions of his son and

419
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,680
successor Henry V who ascended the

420
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,920
throne in

421
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,839
1413 under King Henry V England

422
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,600
witnessed some of the most most defining

423
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,040
events in its history such as the

424
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,600
renewal of the Hundred Years War with

425
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,959
France and the stunning Victory gained

426
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,160
at the Battle of aenor in 1415 which

427
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,919
thereafter became enshrined in English

428
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,600
Legend however Henry's untimely death in

429
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,360
1422 initiated a reversal in England's

430
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,600
fortunes his infant son Henry V 6

431
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,799
inherited the throne but his Reign was

432
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,039
marked by overall defeats of France in

433
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,480
the ongoing conflict culminating in the

434
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
English being driven out of virtually

435
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,440
the entire territory by

436
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,440
1453 Henry the 6 position worsened in

437
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,400
the following years with discontent

438
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,280
among the feuding nobility sparking

439
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,039
another civil war in

440
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,679
1455 named the wars of the Roses in

441
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,400
reference to the emblems of the two

442
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,039
branches of the plantagenet dynasty the

443
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,720
white rose of York and the red rose of

444
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,960
Lancaster the fighting continued

445
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,480
radically for the next 30 years until

446
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,840
Henry chuda the last last surviving male

447
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,120
of the lancastrian line returned from

448
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,760
Exile in France and defeated the yorkist

449
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,640
King Richard III at the Battle of

450
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,919
Bosworth field in

451
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,000
1485 England then transitioned into a

452
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,440
period of relative peace owing to the

453
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,360
houses of Lancaster and York uniting

454
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,400
under King Henry II's marriage to

455
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,840
Elizabeth of York which ushered in the

456
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,760
establishment of the chuda dynasty the

457
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,720
war ravaged economy was gradually

458
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,360
rebuilt and the enlightened idea which

459
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,960
had emerged during the Renaissance in

460
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,400
Italy made their way into English

461
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,120
society when Henry viith died in 1509 he

462
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,400
was succeeded by his son Henry VII whose

463
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,960
Reign started off promisingly but later

464
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,039
descended into tyranny and became one of

465
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,559
the most disruptive in all of English

466
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,919
History this was largely caused by his

467
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,240
desire for a male Heir his first

468
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,120
marriage to Catherine of aragan produced

469
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,400
only one surviving daughter Mary after

470
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
his grounds for divorce for rejected by

471
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,000
the pope Henry decided to split England

472
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,799
away from the Catholic church and

473
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,120
establish his own Protestant Church of

474
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,360
England this caused a great deal of

475
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,480
religious upheaval within the country

476
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
and would later give rise to a period of

477
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,360
sectarianism which would last for the

478
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,200
best part of 100 years Henry's

479
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
subsequent marriages and hopes for a

480
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,360
series of male successes fared little

481
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,200
better his second wife and berin was

482
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,280
executed after producing only one

483
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,960
daughter named Elizabeth his third third

484
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,720
wife Jane Seymour died from

485
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
complications after giving birth to a

486
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,559
son named Edward his fourth marriage to

487
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:38,600
an of cleaves ended in divorce his fifth

488
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,280
wife Katherine Howard was executed for

489
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,240
being unfaithful and his sixth and final

490
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,760
wife Katherine par was the only one to

491
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,919
survive with her reputation and head

492
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,120
intact owing to Henry himself dying in

493
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,559
1547 succeeded by his only son Edward v

494
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,960
6 England became radically more

495
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,440
Protestant under his rule although it

496
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,480
was to be shortlived for Edward died of

497
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,159
tuberculosis in

498
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:07,760
1553 he was in turn succeeded by his

499
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,320
Half Sister Mary who was married to King

500
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,960
Philip II of Spain and was a devout

501
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,799
Catholic Mary's reign as Queen witnessed

502
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,880
the fall of the last English outpost on

503
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,880
the continent C to the French in 1558

504
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,039
but her Reign was mostly defined by

505
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,640
attempts to reverse the recent

506
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,720
Protestant Reformation in England by

507
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,159
severely persecuting

508
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,480
any adherence to the faith some 280

509
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,039
people were burned at the stake under

510
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,200
her oppressive rule earning her the

511
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,280
epithet of Bloody Mary despite being

512
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,240
married she too failed to produce an

513
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,400
heir and so upon her death in 1558 the

514
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,600
Throne of England passed to her half

515
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,880
sister

516
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,799
Elizabeth under Queen Elizabeth the

517
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,919
England entered a golden age of

518
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,840
prosperity the Protestant Church of

519
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,080
England was reestablished and some

520
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,600
degree of religious tolerance was GR

521
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,840
granted towards Catholics the

522
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,679
instruments of the state were greatly

523
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,240
strengthened through new laws and proper

524
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Administration which consequently led to

525
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,960
the population of the country growing

526
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,480
significantly reaching some 5 million

527
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,080
people by the early 17th century

528
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,039
Elizabeth and England also saw an

529
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,400
increase in the art and literature with

530
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,960
the likes of William Shakespeare

531
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,400
producing some of the nation's most

532
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,919
famous works and plays which remained

533
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,559
popular to this very day there was also

534
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,159
a significant upshift in England's

535
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,480
economic and accompanying military might

536
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,440
during this time largely brought about

537
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,159
by the expansion of English commercial

538
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,880
interests in the Americas and Asia

539
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,400
figures such as Sir Walter rally and Sir

540
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,799
Francis Drake pioneered England's

541
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,960
emergence as a powerful Maritime Nation

542
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,840
leading expeditions to newly discovered

543
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
parts of the world and successfully

544
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,880
defending England in its most desperate

545
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,480
hour of need against the Spanish Armada

546
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,679
in

547
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,240
1588 nevertheless Elizabeth the died

548
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,200
childless in 16003 and so the throne

549
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,720
passed to her closest male Protestant

550
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,799
relative King James I 6 of Scotland of

551
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,200
the House of Stewart who subsequently

552
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,840
became King James I of England through

553
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,679
the union of the

554
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:17,080
crowns despite being the king of both

555
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,240
Nations and ruling over virtually the

556
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,360
entire island of Britain the two

557
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,039
kingdoms remained separate from one

558
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,799
another James's early Reign faced many

559
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:27,799
challenges the most notable being the

560
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,559
Gunpowder Plot of 16005 which saw

561
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,840
discontent English Catholics attempts to

562
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,799
blow up the king during the state

563
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,640
opening of parliament it was also during

564
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,520
this time that the first permanent

565
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,679
English colonies were established in

566
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,200
places like America and India which

567
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,880
would go on to form the basis for the

568
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,240
British Empire in centuries to come the

569
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,159
latter part of King James's Reign was

570
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:53,000
marked by increasing tensions with

571
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Parliament over governance of the

572
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,159
country these issues however would come

573
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:59,240
to a dramatic head during the reign of

574
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,000
his son Charles

575
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,400
I disagreements over power religious

576
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
Affairs and governance within the

577
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,679
kingdom coupled with King Charles I's

578
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,240
refusal to cooperate with Parliament led

579
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,200
to Growing discontent between the two

580
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,240
centers of power in England eventually

581
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,880
in 1642 armed conflicts broke out with

582
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,919
the English Civil War being fought

583
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,799
between the forces loyal to the king

584
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:26,080
called royalists and the parliamentarian

585
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,559
forces called Roundheads

586
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,520
pitched battles such as those fought at

587
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,600
Edge Hill Maron Moore and nby were

588
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,039
pivotal in determining the war's outcome

589
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,600
which ultimately ended in Victory for

590
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,240
the parliamentarian New Model Army under

591
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,919
the leadership of Oliver Cromwell for

592
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,840
his role in allowing the country to

593
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,000
descend into a chaotic state of Civil

594
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,480
War King Charles I was executed in 1649

595
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,679
and England briefly became a republic

596
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,520
with Cromwell as its

597
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,880
leader the monarchy was eventually

598
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,600
restored in 1660 however with King

599
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,559
Charles II returning to London albeit

600
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,320
with his power significantly reduced the

601
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
country was still in a fragile state

602
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,880
after the Civil War and two events which

603
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,880
struck London in the mid 1660s the Great

604
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,520
Plague of 1665 and the great fire of

605
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,240
1666 did great damage to the nation's

606
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,200
capital Charles II's Reign ended with

607
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
his death in 1685 and was succeeded by

608
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,039
his brother James II

609
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,399
however this quickly ignited another

610
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:33,679
political Ferrari within the kingdom

611
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,360
owing to James being a devout Catholic

612
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,640
and rumors that he wished for England to

613
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,279
return to the old Faith various

614
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,399
political factions quickly pressed for

615
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,240
his Protestant daughter Mary and her

616
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,159
Dutch husband Prince William of Orange

617
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,600
to replace him in what became known as

618
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,840
the Glorious

619
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,960
Revolution William landed with an

620
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
invasion force on England's South Coast

621
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,960
in November 1688 but did not wish to

622
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,520
seek an open battle believing that James

623
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,919
II's regime would collapse on its own

624
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,320
this duly happened and James fled to

625
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,480
France leaving the throne vacant for

626
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,679
William and Mary to assume the role of

627
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,080
king and queen under joint

628
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,520
rule despite James's seeming abdication

629
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,799
he did have some support in Ireland and

630
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,720
so decided to launch a military campaign

631
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,640
there with the hope of restoring him to

632
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,080
the throne James was nevertheless

633
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,360
defeated by the forces of King William

634
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,320
III in battle and was forced to flee to

635
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,200
France once again the continuation of

636
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,520
the Catholic House of Stewart in Exile

637
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,240
however would continue to threaten

638
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,159
England's political establishment well

639
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:40,679
into the next

640
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,159
Century England returned to relative

641
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:45,679
peace under the rule of William and Mary

642
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,279
for they both accepted the Bill of

643
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,000
Rights in 1689 which significantly

644
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,279
reduced the power of the crown by

645
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,039
recognizing the authority and

646
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:56,520
sovereignty of parliament during the

647
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,480
reign of Queen Anne who inherited the

648
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,840
throne from her sister Mary the English

649
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,760
and Scottish parliaments were formerly

650
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,440
merged into one thereby creating the

651
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,919
Parliament and Kingdom of Great Britain

652
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,960
through the acts of Union in

653
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,520
1707 Queen Anne was the last of the

654
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,880
Stewart Dynasty to sit on the throne and

655
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,080
owing to a recently introduced law that

656
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,640
allowed only Protestants to become

657
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Regent upon her death the crown passed

658
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,000
to her distant second cousin the German

659
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,799
Prince George of

660
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,320
Hanover from that point onwards the

661
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,159
history of England would no longer be

662
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,480
that of a separate Sovereign Nation but

663
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,919
rather that of one of the four nations

664
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,919
that made up the United Kingdom England

665
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:40,960
and for that matter Britain under the

666
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,640
hanovarian kings of the 18th century

667
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,720
transitioned into becoming a modern

668
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,440
nation state growing Commerce and

669
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,760
mercantilism propelled the country into

670
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,799
becoming the leading Global Maritime

671
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,240
power of the age which was backed up by

672
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,960
the military might of the royal Navy on

673
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
the high seas Britain's colonies also

674
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,520
increased in importance during this time

675
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,480
however the loss of America during the

676
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,399
war of independence significantly

677
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,200
damaged the country's prestige on the

678
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,080
world stage the only real domestic

679
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,399
threat to the nation was posed by the

680
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,159
descendants of the exiled House of

681
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:17,320
Stewart Living in France who

682
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,000
unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow

683
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,679
the British government and Georgian

684
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,399
monarchy on two separate occasions in

685
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:24,840
what became known as the Jacoby

686
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,399
rebellions of 1715 and 1745

687
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,559
the 19th century would see Britain

688
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,080
become the pre-eminent global superpower

689
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,799
of the age thanks to the Innovations

690
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,600
introduced by the Industrial Revolution

691
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,679
these accelerated the nation's economic

692
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,919
output and allowed for further expansion

693
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,960
of the British Empire it would become

694
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,080
the largest to have ever existed in the

695
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,600
history of the world although the

696
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,519
defining events of the following 20th

697
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,080
century namely the first and second

698
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,360
world wars would virtually bankrupt the

699
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,399
nation and initiate the beginning of the

700
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:02,399
end for Britain's dominance as a world

701
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,880
power the past 2,000 years of history

702
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,840
have undoubtedly left their mark on the

703
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,399
Modern English Nation with its people

704
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,080
being made up of the descendants of the

705
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,440
various groups who arrived on its Shores

706
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,159
over the centuries although the impacts

707
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,440
of these events May no longer be all

708
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
that visible to the modern eye their

709
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,960
legacy is perhaps more noticeable in the

710
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,159
Modern English language that we speak

711
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,480
today whether it be the words borrowed

712
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,039
from Latin introduced by the Romans the

713
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,480
Germanic of the Anglo-Saxons the Old

714
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,760
Norse of the Vikings or the French of

715
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,360
the Normans England's language is a

716
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,640
result of the constant Evolution and

717
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,360
adaptability of its speakers which is

718
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,240
perhaps why it has become the most

719
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,640
spoken language in the world
